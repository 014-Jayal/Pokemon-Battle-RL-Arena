# Pokémon Battle Arena: Reinforcement Learning Project

> **An AI Agent that learns to master Pokémon-style battles using Reinforcement Learning (PPO)**

---

## Overview

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** framework where an AI agent learns to win **Pokémon battles** using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.  
Built completely from scratch, it combines **custom environment design**, **type-based combat mechanics**, and **cinematic video visualization** of battles.

---

## Problem Statement

> Can an AI agent, without any pre-programmed rules, learn to play and win Pokémon battles purely through Reinforcement Learning?

This project builds a **custom Gymnasium environment** that allows an RL agent to learn **attack, defend, and heal strategies** based only on rewards and state transitions.

## Key Features

✅ **Custom RL Environment** — Built entirely using `gymnasium`  
✅ **PPO Agent (Stable-Baselines3)** — Learns through self-play and reward optimization  
✅ **Type-Based Combat System** — Fire 🔥 > Grass 🌿 > Water 💧 > Fire 🔥  
✅ **Dynamic Opponent Pool** — Battles with random Pokémon for diverse learning  
✅ **Visual Output** — Generates `.mp4` battle replays for analysis  
✅ **Reward Engineering** — Balanced incentives for attack, defense, and healing

## Methodology

1. **Custom Environment Creation**  
   - Defines HP, Energy, Actions, and Type Advantages  
   - Implements Gym-compatible reset and step functions  

2. **Agent Training (PPO)**  
   - Observes state `[HP, Energy, Opponent HP, Turn]`  
   - Takes actions: *Light Attack, Heavy Attack, Guard, Recover*  
   - Learns via reward feedback (damage dealt, win/loss)  

3. **Evaluation & Tournament Phase**  
   - Trained model battles multiple opponents (randomly selected)  
   - Results recorded and visualized as MP4 battle videos

## How to Run

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Pokemon-Battle-RL-Arena.git
cd Pokemon-Battle-RL-Arena
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Notebook
Open `Pokemon_Battle_RL_Arena.ipynb` in Google Colab or VS Code Jupyter.

### 4️⃣ Train and Watch Battles
After training, run the **tournament cell** — it will:
- Generate videos under `/battle_videos/`
- Display inline replay battles
